# Fundamentals of Remote Sensing and Earth Observation 

This course focuses on the application of remotely sensed geospatial datasets to analyze physical processes on Earth. We will study the fundamentals of working with geospatial data, and cover topics such as projections, coordinate reference systems and cartography. We will utilize public satellite imagery datasets across the frequency spectrum, including but not limited to optical, infrared, thermal and radar. Students will develop a strong understanding of multiple tools and techniques to process remotely sensed data, including Google Earth Engine, GDAL and QGIS. Students will regularly apply machine learning and image processing algorithms to remotely sensed data throughout the course, and are expected to have strong Python programming skills (e.g. familiarity with Numpy, OpenCV, TensorFlow). The culmination of the course will be a project of the student's choosing, focused on a specific application area of earth observation.

## Projects:
### 1. GeoTIFF manipulation and Dataset Aggregation
> Re-project, resample, and change the spatial extent of GeoTIFFs. Aggregate different metrics over a dataset of GeoTIFFs and write out the results
### 2. Land Cover Classification
> Perform image segmentation to classify land. Perform a thorough preprocessing stage on tf.dataset objects to normalize, augment, and manipulate input. 
### 3. Final Project 
> Independent student choice
